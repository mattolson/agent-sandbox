# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`agentbox` CLI.** New command-line tool for initializing and managing sandboxed projects. Commands:
  - `agentbox init` - interactive setup: select agent (Claude Code / GitHub Copilot), mode (CLI / devcontainer), IDE (VS Code / JetBrains / none), and configure volumes
  - `agentbox exec` - start or attach to the agent container
  - `agentbox edit policy` - open the network policy in your editor, auto-restarts proxy on save
  - `agentbox edit compose` - open the compose file in your editor
  - `agentbox bump` - pull latest images and pin to new digests
  - `agentbox <command>` - pass-through to `docker compose` with the correct project file
  - `agentbox clean` - remove containers, volumes, and config directories
  - `agentbox version` - show version info

- **Docker-based CLI distribution.** Run the CLI without a local install:
  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/mattolson/agent-sandbox-cli
  alias agentbox='docker run --rm -it -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -v"$PWD:$PWD" -w"$PWD" -e TERM -e HOME --network none ghcr.io/mattolson/agent-sandbox-cli'
  ```

- **GitHub Copilot agent support.** New `agent-sandbox-copilot` image and templates for running GitHub Copilot CLI in a sandbox.

- **JetBrains IDE support.** Devcontainer mode supports JetBrains IDEs with appropriate capabilities and plugin configuration.

- **Image pinning during init.** `agentbox init` pulls images and pins them to their digest in the generated compose file for reproducibility.

- **Bash 3.2 compatibility.** The CLI works with the default Bash shipped on macOS.

### Changed

- **Default proxy policy now blocks all traffic.** The baked-in proxy policy no longer allows GitHub by default. You must mount a policy file to allow any outbound requests.

- **Policy files generated per-project.** `agentbox init` creates the policy at `.agent-sandbox/policy-<mode>-<agent>.yaml` inside your project. This replaces the previous approach of copying policy examples to `~/.config/agent-sandbox/policies/`.

- **Simplified base image.** Removed optional packages to reduce image size and build time:
  - `yq` (YAML processor)
  - `git-delta` (diff viewer)
  - `zsh-in-docker` / powerline10k theme

  The base image now ships with a minimal zsh configuration. To add these tools or customize further, create a derived image:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM ghcr.io/mattolson/agent-sandbox-base:latest

  # Install git-delta
  RUN ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture) && \
    wget "https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases/download/0.18.2/git-delta_0.18.2_${ARCH}.deb" && \
    dpkg -i "git-delta_0.18.2_${ARCH}.deb" && \
    rm "git-delta_0.18.2_${ARCH}.deb"

  # Or mount your own dotfiles for shell customization
  ```

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-25 (1a9103d)

Proxy-based network enforcement. This release replaces the iptables-only domain blocking with a two-layer architecture: mitmproxy sidecar for domain enforcement + iptables to prevent bypassing the proxy.

### Breaking Changes

- **SSH is blocked.** Port 22 is now blocked to prevent SSH tunneling that could bypass the proxy. Git must use HTTPS. The container auto-rewrites `git@github.com:` URLs to `https://github.com/`, but you may need to run `gh auth login` for push access to private repos.

- **Policy files managed by CLI.** Policy files are generated by `agentbox init` and stored in your project at `.agent-sandbox/policy-<mode>-<agent>.yaml`. They are mounted read-only into the proxy container. The agent cannot modify its own allowlist.

- **Separate compose files for CLI and devcontainer.** To avoid container/volume name conflicts when running both modes:
  - CLI mode: `.agent-sandbox/docker-compose.yml`
  - Devcontainer mode: `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`

  Use `agentbox init` to generate the appropriate configuration.

- **Two-container architecture.** The stack now runs two containers: `agent` and `proxy`. The proxy sidecar runs mitmproxy and enforces the domain allowlist. Update any scripts that assume a single container.

### Added

- Proxy sidecar (mitmproxy) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic logging and enforcement
- Domain allowlist enforcement at the proxy level with clear 403 error messages
- Log mode for observing what domains an agent needs (set `PROXY_MODE=log`)
- Structured JSON logging of all proxied requests
- `gh` CLI pre-installed for GitHub operations
- Auto-rewrite of git SSH URLs to HTTPS

### Changed

- Firewall now blocks all direct outbound except to Docker bridge network (forces traffic through proxy)
- Policy changes take effect on proxy restart (`docker compose restart proxy`) instead of container rebuild

### Removed

- Direct domain-based iptables rules (replaced by proxy enforcement)
- SSH (port 22) access

## [0.2.5] - 2025-01-22 (835c541)

### Added

- Shell customization via `~/.config/agent-sandbox/shell.d/` mount
- Support for dotfiles directory mounting

### Added

- Multi-platform images (amd64 + arm64) published to GitHub Container Registry
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- Image digest pinning for reproducibility

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-17 (98ad81d)

Initial release.
