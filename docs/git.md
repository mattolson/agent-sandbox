# Git Configuration

Git operations can be run from the host or from inside the container.

## Git from host (recommended)

Run git commands (clone, commit, push) from your host terminal. The agent writes code, you handle version control. No credential setup needed inside the container.

## Git from container

If you want the agent to run git commands, some setup is required.

**SSH is blocked.** Port 22 is blocked to prevent SSH tunneling, which could bypass the proxy. The container automatically rewrites SSH URLs to HTTPS:

```
git@github.com:user/repo.git -> https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

**Credential setup.** To push or access private repos, authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
gh auth login
```

This stores a token in the container's Claude state volume (persists across rebuilds). The gh CLI configures git to use this token automatically.

**Alternative: Fine-grained PAT.** For tighter access control, create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) scoped to specific repositories, then:

```bash
gh auth login --with-token < token.txt
```
